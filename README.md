# GPTool - Your AI Companion on WhatsApp 🚀

## 🌐 About Us
Welcome to GPTool, where we turn the magic of AI into reality on WhatsApp! Our mission is to make AI a breeze for everyone. Say goodbye to tech barriers; say hello to a new era of AI simplicity and accessibility.

## 🚀 How it Works?
Just shoot us a message on WhatsApp, and watch the AI magic unfold! Type your query, and GPTool will charm you with informative responses powered by the brilliance of GPT. It's like having a genius at your fingertips, ready to chat!

## 💰 Is there any cost?
Good news! GPTool is a non-profit project for now, breaking down barriers for those who find text generative tools a bit too cryptic. It's free with a twist — there's a monthly cap of 50 messages. Help us keep the dream alive by reaching out for more usage or throwing some love our way with a small donation. Your name will forever be etched in the GPTool Hall of Fame!

## 🚀 What's Up Next?
Currently weaving magic with text, but brace yourself for what's on the horizon! Exciting plans are brewing, including the mystique of image generation! Stay tuned as GPTool continues to evolve.

## 🔓 Open Source Journey
While GPTool is currently a well-guarded secret, we're planning to unlock the magic! Our future holds the key to open-sourcing this enchanting project. Stay with us as we prepare to share the spellbook with fellow enchanters.
